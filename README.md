# Star Wars: The Data Awakens

While waiting for Star Wars: The Force Awakens to come out, the team at [FiveThirtyEight](http://fivethirtyeight.com/) became interested in answering some questions about Star Wars fans. In particular, they wondered: does the rest of America realize that “The Empire Strikes Back” is clearly the best of the bunch?

The team needed to collect data addressing this question. To do this, they surveyed Star Wars fans using the online tool SurveyMonkey. They received 835 total responses, which can be downloaded from [their GitHub repository](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/star-wars-survey).

This project aims at cleaning and exploring the dataset and finding answers to some interesting questions!
